Create s3 bucket manually&terraform


Create s3 bucket  and upload  file to s3 in  manuall process
#################
1. AWS management Console
	create bucket on aws s3
	upload any .extension file
	
2. AWS cli(command line Interface)
	in personal windows machine or aws ec2 instance, we have to make sure aws cli is installed.
	we can create ec2 instance of amazon linux or rhel or ubuntu
		if it is amazon linux by default aws cli is installed.
		if it is rhel or ubuntu we need to install aws cli.
		
	first we create a bucket and upload .extension file  on remote to s3
	we can create ec2 instance on ubuntu
		1. create ec2 instance with ubuntu
		2. connect instance ip with mobaexterm
		3. sudo apt update -y
		4. sudo apt install aws cli -y

	from ec2 machine i want to upload a file to s3 bucket or from ec2 machine i want to download a file from s3 bucket
	 now i want to 			
		from ec2 machine i want to download a file from s3 bucket to local
			now i want to download a file from s3 bucket so that the command is
			aws s3 cp sources3uri dest
			aws s3 cp s3://harithabkt/devops /home/ubuntu
			we have to  give permission credentials of IAM user .so that create IAM user and open that user and go to security credentials
					Access key : AKIATXDHF2ARRPPYMXWX
					Secret access key : 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
					or
			we have to  give permission credentials of IAM role .so that create IAM role 
				create role  and modift that role and upload the role then run the command is
				aws s3 cp s3://harithabkt/devopsquestions /home/ubuntu
				
		from ec2 machine i want to upload a file local to s3 bucket
			cp devops devops_s3

			aws s3 cp /home/ubuntu/devops_s3 s3://harithabkt/ 	 ---------> upload file from  local to s3 bucket
			
			aws s3 ls  harithabkt					---------------> listing the  files

3. programatically
	now i upload the one python file to s3
	so that i can create file in linux/mobaexterm
	i.e  
		1. vi students.csv
		2. ls
		3. cat students.csv
		4. python3
		https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-uploading-files.html
			import logging
			import boto3
			s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
			s3_client.upload_file(file_name, bucket, object_name)
							or
			s3_client.upload_file('/home/ubuntu/students.csv', 'harithabkt', 'students.csv')
			
As a Devops engineer our goal is to make sure aws s3 bucket is created and if needed we need to upload file using terraform code as well.





Create s3 bucket  and upload  file to s3 i with terraform script
#############################
we need to write terrafoem 	scripot or code to create s3 bucket and upload file to s3 bucket
To work with terraform we need IAM user or IAM role and terraform provider and installing terraform

Now im create IAM USER
	Access key : AKIATXDHF2ARUX3D7EZP
	Secret access key: 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
		or
Now iam create IAM role
	

S3 bucket using terraform
1. We have to make sure first installl terraform on ubuntu i.each
	https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli
		 1. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
		 2. sudo apt update
		 3. wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
		 gpg --dearmor | \
		 sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
		 4. echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] \
		 https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | \
		 sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
		 5. sudo apt-get install terraform
		 6. terraform --version
		 
2. now we have terraform provider		 
1. mkdir terraform-s3
2. cd terraform-s3
3. pwd
4. ls
5. vi providers.tf
i.e
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
		
3. now we have to create terraform bucket,so that we have to write terraform script/resources i.e
https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket
	vi s3.tf
	
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "haritha-bucket"

  tags = {
    Name        = "My bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}		
		
4. terraform init
5. terraform plan
6. terraform apply --auto-approve

7. now s3 bucket created. now through this bucket i want to upload file using terraform. that is called aws s3 object.
	Uploading a file to a bucket
	vi s3.tf
resource "aws_s3_object" "object" {
  bucket = "your_bucket_name"
  key    = "new_object_key"
  source = "path/to/file"

  # The filemd5() function is available in Terraform 0.11.12 and later
  # For Terraform 0.11.11 and earlier, use the md5() function and the file() function:
  # etag = "${md5(file("path/to/file"))}"
  etag = filemd5("path/to/file")
}
		AS

resource "aws_s3_object" "object" {
  bucket = "haritha-bucket"
  key    = "devops"
  source = "/home/ubuntu/students.csv"

  # The filemd5() function is available in Terraform 0.11.12 and later
  # For Terraform 0.11.11 and earlier, use the md5() function and the file() function:
  # etag = "${md5(file("path/to/file"))}"
  etag = filemd5("home/ubuntu/students.csv")
}

8. terraform apply
