Shell Scripting class 1
###################

what is shell scripting?

what are the concepts involved in shell scripting?

how to write basic shell scripts and execute them?

using shell script if we have any task or work which will take time to execute, 
rather than doing every time manual will use shell script.

shell script is used for repetetive tasks.
	like running java applcation
	checking files/folders exists or not, if not create file/folders
	database backup or restore
	
	installatio of packages
	creation of users

	copying files from one server to another server

now if you want to write shell script firat you will understand 
	what is shebang in shell script?
	and in shell script what are different concepts?
	in order to write a good shell script what are the basics/scenarios you need. so that we learn them first after rthat we will write shell script.
	
	
shell script
############################

let me try to see one basic shell script i.e in search mysql backup and restore shell script
https://tecadmin.net/bash-script-mysql-database-backup/


what is shebang in shell script?
https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Shebang
##########

Starting a Script With #!
It is called a shebang or a "bang" line.
It is nothing but the absolute path to the Bash interpreter.
It consists of a number sign and an exclamation point character (#!), followed by the full path to the interpreter such as /bin/bash.
All scripts under Linux execute using the interpreter specified on a first line[1].
Almost all bash scripts often begin with #!/bin/bash (assuming that Bash has been installed in /bin)
This ensures that Bash will be used to interpret the script, even if it is executed under another shell[2].
The shebang was introduced by Dennis Ritchie between Version 7 Unix and 8 at Bell Laboratories. It was then also added to the BSD line at Berkeley.


USECASE
now i want ro checking files/folders exists or not
#########################

1. first let me create a shell script for workspace
	go to gitbash in windows
	 mkdir shellscript-workspace
	 cd shellscript-workspace/
	 ls

2. how to check my file is exist or not
	let me take one example and create some file
	in gitbash
		touch sample.txt
		pwd
		find /c/Users/Srinadh/shellscript-workspace -name sample.txt
			/c/Users/Srinadh/shellscript-workspace/sample.txt
	it is showing like this is manual of one file ,
	now imagine about automation find group of files using shell script howw to find this path(/c/Users/Srinadh/shellscript-workspace/sample.txt)

	let me take another example
	in gitbash
		touch file1.txt
		touch file2.txt
		touch file3.txt
		now i want/how to see these three files are exist or not in at a time.means will use shell script

by using shell script we need to know some basic shell script operators.

File Test Operators
#########################
We have a few operators that can be used to test various properties associated with a Unix file.

Assume a variable file holds an existing file name "test" the size of which is 100 bytes and has read, write and execute permission on −

Show Examples

Operator					Description																											Example
-b file	Checks 				if file is a block special file; if yes, then the condition becomes true.											[ -b $file ] is false.
-c file	Checks 				if file is a character special file; if yes, then the condition becomes true.										[ -c $file ] is false.
-d file	Checks 				if file is a directory; if yes, then the condition becomes true.													[ -d $file ] is not true.
-f file	Checks			 	if file is an ordinary file as opposed to a directory or special file; if yes, then the condition becomes true.		[ -f $file ] is true.
-g file	Checks 				if file has its set group ID (SGID) bit set; if yes, then the condition becomes true.								[ -g $file ] is false.
-k file	Checks				if file has its sticky bit set; if yes, then the condition becomes true.											[ -k $file ] is false.
-p file	Checks 				if file is a named pipe; if yes, then the condition becomes true.													[ -p $file ] is false.
-t file	Checks 				if file descriptor is open and associated with a terminal; if yes, then the condition becomes true.					[ -t $file ] is false.
-u file	Checks 				if file has its Set User ID (SUID) bit set; if yes, then the condition becomes true.								[ -u $file ] is false.
-r file	Checks				if file is readable; if yes, then the condition becomes true.														[ -r $file ] is true.
-w file	Checks 				if file is writable; if yes, then the condition becomes true.														[ -w $file ] is true.
-x file	Checks 				if file is executable; if yes, then the condition becomes true.														[ -x $file ] is true.
-s file	Checks 				if file has size greater than 0; if yes, then condition becomes true.												[ -s $file ] is true.
-e file	Checks				if file exists; is true even if file is a directory but exists.														[ -e $file ] is true.


for our requirement we use file test operators ,by using this we know our file is existing or not

3. File Test Operators
	-f file	--->Checks if file is an o rdinary file as opposed to a directory or special file; if yes, then the condition becomes true. [ -f $file ] is true.
	sysntax is 
	[ -f $file ]

	file="/c/Users/Srinadh/shellscript-workspace/sample.txt"

	in gitbash
		file="/c/Users/Srinadh/shellscript-workspace/sample.txt"
		 echo $file
			/c/Users/Srinadh/shellscript-workspace/sample.txt

if you want to use/run this file operetor/[ -f $file ] we need to know about if else condition as well.

if else condition using shell script for file Exist
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/if-else-statement.htm
#############

Syntax
if [ expression ]
then
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
else
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression is not true
fi



if [ -f $file ]
then
   echo "file exists"
else
   echo "file not exists"
fi

	file exists


if else condition using shell script for file not Exist
################
in gitbash
	filenotexist="/c/Users/Srinadh/shellscript-workspace/hello.txt"


if [ -f $filenotexist ]
then
   echo "file exists"
else
   echo "file not exists"
fi

	file not exists
	


4. arrays and  looping the array
now this is for one file but
	i want to do it for multiple files using the concept called arrays and  looping the array
	
arrays and  looping the array
https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-for-loop-array/
#######################
Array----->BY USING ARRAY ALL THE EXISTING FILES ARE GETTING IN ONE SHOT


To declare an array in bash sysntax is
# Let us declare an array called array and assign three values when using bash:

	array=( one two three )
				OR	

# Indexed arrays (numbered list starting from zero )#

	declare -a ARRAY_NAME_HERE=(value1 value2 .... valueN)
	declare -a nameservers=(google cloudflare isp1)
	nameservers[3]=isp2
	
IN OUR CASE sysntax is

FileToBeExist=( file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt)
				OR	
				
declare -a FileToBeExist=(file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

in git bash
	FileToBeExist=( file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt)
	echo $FileToBeExist
		file1.txt

				OR	
				
	declare -a FileToBeExist=(file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt)
	 echo $FileToBeExist
	file1.txt

5. in this case we have seen only first parameter,but i want all files existing, so that sysntax is

	${FileToBeExist[@]} 
		or
	
	${FileToBeExist[*]}
	
in gitbash 
	echo ${FileToBeExist[@]}	
		file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
		or
	echo ${FileToBeExist[*]}
		file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
		
6. if you want to know the length of array so that sysntax is

	${#FileToBeExist[@]} 
		or
	
	${#FileToBeExist[*]}
	
in gitbash 
	echo ${#FileToBeExist[@]}
		3
		or
	echo ${#FileToBeExist[*]}	
		3
		
		
Looping THROUGH ARRAY sysntax
#############
LOOP THROUGH ARRAY MEANS I GET ONE FILE NAME  EVERY TIME AND CHECT THIS IS EXIST OR NOT


#!/bin/bash
# declare an array called array and define 3 vales
array=( one two three )
for i in "${array[@]}"
do
	echo "$i"
done

		as
		
		
for i in "${FileToBeExist[@]}"
do
	echo "$i"
done

	file1.txt
	file2.txt
	file3.txt



7. use of file test operators
in gitbash

for FileToBeExist in "${FileToBeExist[@]}"
do
	if [ -f $FileToBeExist ]
then
   echo "file exists"
else
   echo "file not exists"
fi
done

		file exists
		file exists
		file exists

		or
		
in visual studiocode
##########

#!/bin/bash
declare -a  FileToBeExist=(file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt)
for FileToBeExist in "${FileToBeExist[@]}"
do
	if [ -f $FileToBeExist ]
    then
        echo "file exists"
    else
        echo "file not exists"
    fi
done

		file exists
		file exists
		file exists


8. if u want to know which file exist
	in gitbash
	
for i in "${FileToBeExist[@]}"
do
	if [ -f $i ]
    then
        echo "$i exists"
    else
        echo "$i not exists"
    fi
done

		file3.txt exists
		file2.txt exists
		file3.txt exists

	in visual studiocode

#!/bin/bash
declare -a  FileToBeExist=(file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt)
for i in "${FileToBeExist[@]}"
do
	if [ -f $i ]
    then
        echo "$i exists"
    else
        echo "$i not exists"
    fi
done

	file1.txt exists
	file2.txt exists
	file3.txt exists
	
	or
	it shows not existing file also
	
#!/bin/bash
declare -a  FileToBeExist=(file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt hello.txt)
for i in "${FileToBeExist[@]}"
do
	if [ -f $i ]
    then
        echo "$i exists"
    else
        echo "$i not exists"
    fi
done

		file1.txt exists
		file2.txt exists
		file3.txt exists
		hello.txt not exists
		
		
8.	if you want to check Directory
##############
syntax is  [ -d $file ]

CheckDirExists="/c/Users/Srinadh/shellscript-workspace"		
		
if [ -d $CheckDirExists ]
then
        echo "$CheckDirExists exist"
else
        echo "$CheckDirExists not exist"
fi	
		
		CheckDirExists is exist
		
		or
		
CheckDirExists=""/c/Users/Srinadh/shellscript-workspace/jshjk"   
		
if [ -d $CheckDirExists ]
then
        echo "$CheckDirExists exist"
else
        echo "$CheckDirExists not exist"
fi	
	
		CheckDirExists is  not exist
		
		
in visual studio code

CheckDirExists="/c/Users/Srinadh/shellscript-workspace"

if [  -d $CheckDirExists ]
    then
        echo "$CheckDirExists is exist"
else
        echo "$CheckDirExists not exist"

Unix / Linux - Shell String Operators 

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-string-operators.htm
##################### 
The following string operators are supported by Bourne Shell.
Assume variable a holds "abc" and variable b holds "efg" then −

Operator	    		 Description																										Example
=	Checks 				if the value of two operands are equal or not; if yes, then the condition becomes true.								[ $a = $b ] is not true.
!=	Checks 				if the value of two operands are equal or not; if values are not equal then the condition becomes true.				[ $a != $b ] is true.
-z	Checks 				if the given string operand size is zero; if it is zero length, then it returns true.								[ -z $a ] is not true.
-n	Checks 				if the given string operand size is non-zero; if it is nonzero length, then it returns true.						[ -n $a ] is not false.
str	Checks 				if str is not the empty string; if it is empty, then it returns false.												[ $a ] is not false.

file path using z flag is used for file is empty or not
############
10 . in gitbash
	filepath="/c/Users/Srinadh/shellscript-workspace/sample.txt "

 if [  -z $filepath ];
then
        echo "filepath is empty"
    else
        echo "filepath not empty"
	
fi

		filepath not empty
		or
		
filepath=""

 if [  -z $filepath ];
then
        echo "filepath is empty"
    else
        echo "filepath not empty"
	
fi

		filepath is empty

in visual studio code


filepath="/c/Users/Srinadh/shellscript-workspace/sample.txt"

if [  -z $filepath ];
then
        echo "filepath is empty"
else
        echo "filepath not empty"
      
fi

		filepath not empty

		or
		
filepath=""

        echo "filepath is empty"
else
        echo "filepath not empty"
      
fi

		filepath is empty
		
		
		
		
		
		
		


Relational Operators
####################
1	some times we may need to check equality of two numbers
		or
2	less than or greater han equal

Bourne Shell supports the following relational operators that are specific to numeric values. These operators do not work for string values unless their value is numeric.
For example, following operators will work to check a relation between 10 and 20 as well as in between "10" and "20" but not in between "ten" and "twenty".
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20 then −



Operator								Description																										Example
-eq	Checks 				if the value of two operands are equal or not; if yes, then the condition becomes true.											[ $a -eq $b ] is not true.
-ne	Checks 				if the value of two operands are equal or not; if values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.						[ $a -ne $b ] is true.
-gt	Checks 				if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.				[ $a -gt $b ] is not true.
-lt	Checks 				if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.					[ $a -lt $b ] is true.
-ge	Checks 				if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	[ $a -ge $b ] is not true.
-le	Checks 				if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.		[ $a -le $b ] is true.


11. in gitbash

define a=10 b=20
if [ $a -eq $b ]
then
        echo "a is eaual to b"
else
        echo "a is not equal to b"
fi


	a is not equal to b

		or
		
if [ $a -eq $b ]
then
        echo "$a is eaual to $b"
else
        echo "$a is not equal to $b"
fi

		10 is not equal to 20


in visualstudio code

a=10
b=20

if [ $a -eq $b ]
then
        echo "a is eaual to b"
else
        echo "a is not equal to b"
fi


    a is not equal to b


a=10
b=20

if [ $a -eq $b ]
then
        echo "$a is eaual to $b"
else
        echo "$a is not equal to $b"
fi

		10 is not equal to 20
		
		
		
		
		



Arithmetic Operators
####################
The following arithmetic operators are supported by Bourne Shell.

Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20 then −


Operator						Description																								Example
+ (Addition)				Adds values on either side of the operator															`expr $a + $b` will give 30
- (Subtraction)				Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand													`expr $a - $b` will give -10
* (Multiplication)			Multiplies values on either side of the operator													`expr $a \* $b` will give 200
/ (Division)				Divides left hand operand by right hand operand														`expr $b / $a` will give 2
% (Modulus)					Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder								`expr $b % $a` will give 0
= (Assignment)				Assigns right operand in left operand																a = $b would assign value of b into a
== (Equality)				Compares two numbers, if both are same then returns true.											[ $a == $b ] would return false.
!= (Not Equality)			Compares two numbers, if both are different then returns true.										[ $a != $b ] would return true.
