where to use ELK and PROMETHEUS and GRAFANA
##########
PROMETHEUS---LOGGING
GRAFANA---MONITORING

Logging--->we want to see application logs in centralised location, in this case we use elastic search and kibana
Monitoring---->we want to capture server or application metrics and want to visualize them

in this case we use prometheus to capture the metrics and grafana to view the metrics present in prometheus.

for example
################
i have a some springboot application and it is generating some logs at some location
now i want to see this application using prometheus and grafana

we need to make sure these logs get transferred to the elastic search and later we can use kibana to view them.

while using this some times its called as logstash
logstash
#######
this means ELK
E means  elastic serch
L means Logstash
K means kibana------------>kibana get data from the elastic search only

the usecase will show for ELK
if you have k8s cluster and that k8s cluster generating some logs then how to send that logs to elastic search
